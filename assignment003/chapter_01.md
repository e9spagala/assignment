# 1. Whetting Your Appetite

I love writing summary in a way that easy to understand through forming the questions out of the content and coming to the conclusion through answering those questions. 

### Who can use python ?
- When we use computers on a daily basis we would always think about a way to automate certain tasks that we tend to do many times such as search and replace, etc.
- Even a ***professional software developer*** want to develop certain tools that helps to improve the productivity of the work that he do. But the problem is the traditional programming languages such as Java or C ++ are slower to develop as there are intermediate steps involved while compiling, debugging or running the project.
- If you want a simple way to write code that finish the task easily compared to the other languages then python is a suitable language for such people.
- The easy english like syntax suits for ***beginners*** and ***non-tech individuals*** to understand and get started with a python easily.

### Why to use python?
- Even though we can use shell scripts to automate daily tasks, it is a complex task and it is harder to debug the code written.
- Python is available in almost all the popular operating systems. So it would be easy to install and setup python without any difficulty.
- Python is a simple, multipurpose programming language that is preloaded with different ***modules*** to add functionalities like I/O operations, servers, sockets, UI interfaces etc.
- Python code is reusable as it support module mechanism.
- As Python is an ***interpreted language*** it will reduce the development time as it has no compilation time.
- Python code is easily readable.
- It is ***extensible*** as Python is build on top of C.

### Extras:

- Python name is given from the famous TV show “Monty Python’s Flying Circus”.
- The maintainers love to have references to that TV show while contributing to the growth of Python.
