# 4. More Control Flow Tools

- Like other programming languages python also have `if`, `if...else`, `if... elif`, control sturctures.
- Python also support `for` as well as `while` loops.
- `range()` is used to iterate over the sequential data structures. It generates arithmetic progressions.

- `break` and `continue` are also used to break away from the loop or skip the current iteration

- we can also use `else` statement for the `for` and `while` loops.
- for a `for` loop else clause executed after loop reaches final iteration. In a `while` loop, after the loopâ€™s condition becomes false.

- `pass` statement does nothing. It is there to mitigate intendation error if we declare a block and did nothing there.
- `match` statements are same like switch statements. The only difference is that match cases don't require break statement like how it is required in C or C ++.
- `_` is used to define the default match case.
- you could specify multiple cases by `|` operator.

### Defining the functions:

- `def` keyword is used for defining a function.
- functions in pythons accept default arguements.
- default arguements are evaluated only once so if you perform any operations on the sequences that will get reflected even if the default declared value of list is empty.

### Document strings:

- Document strings are used to write summary and the syntax of the function defined.
